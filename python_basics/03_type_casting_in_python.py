#Here we will see about type casting in python
#Type casting means to change the data type of variable to another type

age = input("Enter your age")

#Here the type of age variable by default is string
print(type(age))

#Now we will change the data type of age variable from string to int
print(type(int(age)))

#in a similar way we can change the data type of int to sting
#just by using str() on top of the variable that we want to chnage the
#Type
