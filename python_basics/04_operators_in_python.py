#Operators in Python
#Basically operators are used with variables to do some basic operations

#1.Arithmetic operators
a=10
b=20
print(a+b) # + operator
print(b-a) # - operator
print(a*b) # multiplication operator

a=2
b=3
print(a**b) #power operator
print(b/a)  #Normal Divsion operator
print(b//a) #floor division operator

a=2
b=6
print(b%a) #remainder division operator or modulo division operator
           #It gives result as remainder value

#2.Comparision operator
a=2
b=3
print(b>a)
print(a>b)
print(a>=b)
print(a<=b)
print(a==b)

#3.Logical Operator like and,or,not
a=2
b=3

print((b>a) and (a>b))
print((b>a) or (a>b))
print(not (a>b))

#4.Assignment operators
a=2
b=3
a=b #here we have used = to assign the value of b to a
print(a)

c=4
c+=1 #it is called complex assignment operator equivalent to c=c+1
print(c)
